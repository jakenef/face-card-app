# FHSS Starter App
_When starting a new project repo in GitHub, use this repository as the template._

This is the starter app for FHSS web applications. It includes all necessary frontend, backend, and development environment code necessary to begin developing. Don't forget to use the included CLI to rename the project from "Starter" to whatever the name of the new project is. 

For instructions on how to get started developing, or in-depth documentation on functionality and relevant technologies, go to the [Docs Repo](https://github.com/FHSS-Web-Team/Documentation)
